This disk obviously makes it impossible to assemble anything in the quasar's vicinity. However, by altering the gravitational constant near the quasar, we could effectively simulate an increase in the object's mass, which would force the disk to shrink to a smaller size. This would in effect both increase its energetic potential, and allow us to construct a structure much closer to the quasar.",
